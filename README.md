# Hello, World!

Hello! My name is Thaís Sousa, and I'm beginning my journey as a developer in 2025. I've always loved everything related to the world of technology, and now I'm fully dedicating myself to studying programming logic and the Full Stack roadmap.

To deepen my knowledge, I'm pursuing a degree in Information Technology, which has given me a broader perspective on the field.

Always seek knowledge!
